            <p><strong>About Us</strong> Jose and Hilcia Garcia started in the restaurant business 13 years ago when they opened El Salvador Restaurant in Irving, Texas. With Jose's degree in business and background in retail, and Hilcia's extensive background in the Travel industry, opening a restaurant was a bold and exciting adventure for them.
Luckily, Hilcia's entire family is involved in the restaurant and food business in the New York city area, so plenty of experienced help was available to help them get started. Hilcia's brother, owner of his own Salvadoran restaurant on Long Island, came to Dallas for six months to help them learn the business. With his help, El Salvador Restaurant was a popular and successful restaurant from the beginning, serving authentic Salvadoran, Peruvian and Mexican food.
Both Jose and Hilcia are originally from El Salvador and Jose came to the U.S. at age 13 through a foreign exchange student program. Hilcia arrived in New York at age 18 where she also attended school and began her career in the travel industry. Because of their El Salvadoran roots, serving authentic Salvadoran food was a must and El Salvador Restaurant serves the best.
Following their success in Irving, Jose and Hilcia wanted to expand their restaurant business into a new area with a different customer base and introduce the delicious foods of El Salvador to new people. Thus was born Puerta Vieja Mexican Grill, which serves Tex Mex along with original Salvadoran dishes made popular in their first restaurant. Keller, being a fast growing and exciting area, offers the perfect spot to introduce new people to new cuisines while offering plenty of the stand-by Tex Mex favorites so popular in this area. </p>
